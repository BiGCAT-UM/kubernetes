# VHP4Safety/EOSC Kubernetes Workshop

* When? August 23-24, 2023
* Venue and address: Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands

This hybrid Kubernetes-oriented meeting is  organized for a range of purposes. First, knowing that there are various toxicology projects with similar goals of creating Kubernetes-like cluster platforms, we would like to bring people who work with Kubernetes together so that they can introduce them to each other and create possibilities for them to collaborate in the future. Attendees will have an environment to share their experiences and evaluate different approaches employed in different projects. Furthermore, we would like to discuss how support groups like SURF (NL), EOSC, and the ELIXIR computer platform can support such developments, and ideally develop plans for helping each other. 

## Why

VHP4Safety is a Dutch research project that aims to build a Virtual Human Platform (VHP) to estimate the risks after being exposed to chemicals and pharmaceuticals without using laboratory animals. As the Department of Bioinformatics at Maastricht University, we participate in this project in various work packages. One work package particularly focuses on creating an online Kubernetes cluster on physical servers to form the computer infrastructure of the platform. 

In this context, we are organizing a meeting/workshop on Kubernetes in Maastricht, the Netherlands for a range of purposes. First, knowing that there are various toxicology projects with similar goals, i.e., creating Kubernetes-like cluster platforms, we would like to bring people who work with Kubernetes together to introduce them to each other and produce possibilities for them to collaborate in the future. We will have an environment in this meeting for people to share their experiences and evaluate different approaches employed in different projects. Furthermore, we would like to discuss how Kubernetes experts from more general computer support groups like SURF (NL), EOSC, and the ELIXIR computer platform can support such developments, and ideally develop concrete plans for helping each other in the future. As a group at the Department of Bioinformatics that is rather new to Kubernetes, we would also appreciate it immensely to have deeper insight from experts on this topic during the event.
