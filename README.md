# VHP4Safety/EOSC Kubernetes Workshop

* When? August 23-24, 2023
* Venue and address: Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands

This hybrid Kubernetes-oriented meeting is  organized for a range of purposes. First, knowing that there are various toxicology projects with similar goals of creating Kubernetes-like cluster platforms, we would like to bring people who work with Kubernetes together so that they can introduce them to each other and create possibilities for them to collaborate in the future. Attendees will have an environment to share their experiences and evaluate different approaches employed in different projects. Furthermore, we would like to discuss how support groups like SURF (NL), EOSC, and the ELIXIR computer platform can support such developments, and ideally develop plans for helping each other.
